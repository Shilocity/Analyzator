At this point, GeoIP is not actually utilized, so one can run the server either by commenting out the require('geoip') line, or by using npm to install geoip (npm install geoip). The software isn't too exciting yet, but if you run the server and then insert an HTML img tag pointing to http://localhost:4134 (such as <img src="http://localhost:4134/">), an image will be served and you will see the hit being recorded in realtime on the server-side.
